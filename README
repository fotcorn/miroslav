Miroslav is a TCP based chat server and client written in C++ using the Qt 4 framework.

I've written this Code in 2007 during my apprenticeship.

The server listens on port 33333 on all IP-Adresses and the password is 'password'.

Features:
* Password protected server (currently hardcoded to 'password')
* Bold/Cursiv/Underlined + Colore message formatting
